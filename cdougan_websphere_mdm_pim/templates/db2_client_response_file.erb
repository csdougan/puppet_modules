** multiple products in an installation is not supported.
PROD                      = <%= @db2_product %>

** The FILE keyword determines the base installation path. If you specify a
** path that does not yet have this product, this will install a new copy.  If
** you specify a path that has this product, this will be considered an
** existing installation intended to install additional functionality.  This is
** a mandatory keyword for root installation. Remove this keyword for non-root
** installation. If not removed, its value must be $HOME/sqllib where $HOME
** represents the HOME directory of the non-root user ID that owns the non-root
** installation.

** INSTALL_TYPE keyword is used to select the installation type. If you specify
** a TYPICAL or a COMPACT install type, no COMP keywords are required. In this
** case the installer will select the appropriate components for you.  All COMP
** keywords are ignored by the installer unless the INSTALL_TYPE is set  to
** CUSTOM. If you select the CUSTOM install type, then ensure that you enable
** all of the COMP keywords that are required for your database environment.
**
** Note: The install type is not related to the language selection.
